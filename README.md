## THIS FORK

Adding some changes that have been working well for me in
a phpbb2 board. We're switching to phpbb3 soon with luck
so I'll need all the same changes here that we had there:

1) "Chat-View" page. "Adams Chat Engine".
    Allows users to view all posts in either
    the whole board, a given forum, or a given
    topic. Shows the first 20 initially, and
    new posts pop into the bottom as they are
    recieved. You can reply just by selecting
    which post you're replying to and writing
    into the reply box at the bottom. Makes
    an IRC-style view on the board content.

2) Events Calendar.
   All topics can have a "Date", and if that's
   set then the topic is called an "Event" and
   it gets an entry in the calendar. Events
   also get a rollcall, in which users who are
   planning to attend the event can click to 
   let everyone know. Existing calendar mods 
   don't attach events to topic threads for
   some reason. Crazy! We do.

3) Skins.
   The "Boing" skins are in this fork, as well as
   the changes needed to the phbb3 skins to make
   the chat-watch and events-calendar work properly.
